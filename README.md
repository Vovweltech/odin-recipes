# Odin Recipes

This is my first project from The Odin Project's Foundations course.  
The goal of this project is to build a basic recipe website using only HTML.

## What I'm Learning

By completing this project, I'm demonstrating my ability to:
- Use basic HTML elements and structure a webpage
- Link multiple pages together using anchor tags
- Organize content into headings, paragraphs, lists, and images
- Work with Git and GitHub using the command line
